movie_manager
=============

a script to manage local movie files. Find by genre, actor, director, and more. 

I wrote this script to help me sort through the hundreds of movies I have on my hard drive, most of which I haven't seen and don't know much about. The script finds your movies, queries RottenTomatoes for data about them, then stores the data in a Postgresql DB. 

TO GET STARTED: 
1) Create a postgresql DB called 'testdb'
2) cd to this directory in your terminal and run './run'  
(that's all there is to it)
